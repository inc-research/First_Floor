/**
 * Exact summation, matching Python's `math.fsum` bit for bit.
 *
 * This module is load-bearing and it is not an optimisation. The golden vectors
 * in `vectors/` are produced by an oracle whose every float accumulation goes
 * through `math.fsum`, so a naive left-to-right loop here reproduces neither
 * vector file. See COMPUTATIONAL_SPEC.md section 0.
 *
 * The reason the oracle uses `fsum` at all is worth knowing, because it looks
 * like fussiness and is not. Python 3.12 changed the `sum()` builtin to use
 * Neumaier compensated summation. The same oracle source therefore produced
 * results differing in the last ulp depending on the interpreter's minor
 * version — a determinism defect under invariant 6. `fsum` is exactly rounded,
 * so it has no version or platform dependence, and it gives this port a target
 * that is a mathematical fact rather than an accident of someone's runtime.
 *
 * Algorithm: Shewchuk's exact summation. Maintain a list of non-overlapping
 * partial sums whose exact total equals the exact total of the inputs, then
 * round once at the end.
 *
 * Adapted from CPython's `math_fsum` in Modules/mathmodule.c, including its
 * half-even fix-up, which is required for agreement on ties.
